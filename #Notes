PACS Linux Distribution Center
==============================

The PACS Linux Distribution Center (LDC) consists of the files, scripts,
and repos needed to install and maintain the PACS supported linux servers
and workstations.  These are made available to the client machines via the
LDC webserver at http://ldc.phys/ldc/. (Currently hosted on avalon.phys w/
ldc.phys as a CNAME alias.)

For installation, we use a custom usb boot-key (PACS-Linux.img,
install/Boot) to launch a network install which uses a cgi-generated
kickstart file (install/*/ks) and local mirrors of the needed rpm
repositories (repos/*).

Standard configuration is done via custom rpms distributed from a
locally-generated rpm repository (pacs/, repos/pacs).

Updates (nightly for workstations, on-demand for servers) are from the
local repo mirrors.


Webserver
---------
The webserver should be configured (/etc/httpd/conf/*) to publish the
repos/* directory-trees and the install/*/ks cgi scripts to our building
subnets and our virtual & colo'd machines.
